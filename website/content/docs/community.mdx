# gooferOrm Community

Features and bug reports can always be reported via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gooferOrm/goofer/issues).
I always look into bug reports, and try my best to fix these.

I host a free discord server for the gooferOrm community. It is a place for deeper discussions, direct communication with me and plenty of other smart people working in the Go ecosystem.
